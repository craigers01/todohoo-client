Prototype Features:

>> Venue has been selected, process NEXT wizard step (date Selection)
X Pass Map Bounds during Add Venue; use them in SQL.
X View Events in your area
X Add venues
- Add events
- Membership
- Add Performer

- AddEvent:
  - Would be nice to, from MyVenues/MyPerformers, click AddEvent to jump into Wizard
  - Let's assume, Select Venue is the first step (Venue ID or Band ID may be passed)
  - Select Venue
    - Select From My Venues (ones I own); Differ to after membership.
    - Select from My Fav Venues (ones I have Marked as Fav) Differ to after membership.
    - Search Map (with search term?)


  - Select Category
  - Add Performer (is this option category dependent) Differ to after Add Performer.
    - Temporary: Just Enter a description
    - Select From My Performer (ones I own); 
    - Select from My Fav Performer (ones I have Marked as Fav)
    - Search Map (with search term?)
  - Select Date/Recurrence 
    - Max-date limit (1 year?). Write all occurrences.
    - Checkbox: Remind me when it is going to expire?
  - Add More Dates for this 
  - Save; update Venue/Performer access date
  - What Next?
  - Enhance instructions on each step.

AddVenue:
X Add Activities should be next Wizard step.
- How do we deal with general/specific Persistent Activities classes? Not sure of an example, but, if indoor/outdoor 
  racketball exists, then we would not want to clutter our dropdown list with all variants.
- SQL error (such as when zipcode was smallint, does not report error; just saves badly).
- Map still flakes out. Maybe rebuild each visit versus move?
X Parse Success
- Notify user of error or success (search the new Venue; encourage add event)
- Wizard is going to need to handle non-sequential steps; maybe now is the time
  to address? Maybe SAVE Venue takes us to the next step (Options of what next:
  Add Events, Return Home..
- Invalid web address (www.reddit.com) does not report issue; i see it in debug

Pending:
- Put Prev/Next buttons somewhere pretty
- Add Search DIV
- Create addEvent page
- Replace menu with menu bar? (available in next jUI release)

Misc Ideas/ Future ToDo:
- Check if venue exists before saving.
- Global error log
- Tabbed info window example: http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobubble/examples/example.html/
- sort by rating/promotion
  - Add Venue/Band rating/promotion in SQL to get final rating
  - Highest rating is also highest Z-order
- Push to prod script; minimified?
- When adding venues, restrict category IDs? so that live music is not persistent?
- Add Categories to capture museum and zoo
- Add code to handle category terms passed to index.php.
  - Run specific search using that criteria (i.e. outsite.com/index.php?GarageSales).
  - We could cross-promote our site to tons of different niches by linking our site on
    related forums/etc. We could specialize the main page according to the category.
- Add Cookies to recall username, default location (use cookie location instead of geo-lookup)
- Give users the option to review events that attended (added to ToDo cart)
- Category Images so that pushpens can have images
- A Performer may have a "Similar to" relationship so that a Tribute Band could be comprehended.
  If Pink Floyd is a Favorite performer of yours, you may want to know when the Austrailian Pink
  Floyd is in town.
- Plan my date. Select Time period, Location, Things to do (Dinner, Dancing, Movie), and let US
  plan your evening! Promotion Nirvana!
- Could our Itenerary data be transferred to a GPS app?
- Prevent Bots from swiping our site. When user sends hits our site; send back some kind of key. Expect that
  key for a DB lookups. That way user cannot write simple script to do a DB lookup. Any script written one
  day would not work the next. They could still figure this out and add the initial hit, but at least make
  them work for it.

DESIGN=====================================
- Temporary Events:
  - Venue tables will have temp column
  - Clean up will delete temporary venues where event has expired (before deleteing event)
- Persistent Events
  - Some venue types have persistent events (i.e. Restaraunt, Bowling Alley). So should this be indicated by a DB field?
  - We should limit persistent events (activity) by event type. Live music = NO.

Data Definitions:
Event: A planned social occasion with a time and venue
 - Scheduled: An event in which there is a date/time it will occur (e.g. Concert)
 - Persistent: An event that is always available (e.g. Bowling, Dinner at a restaurant)
Venue: Location where one or multiple events can occur. Name may not be unique.
Entertainer: An performer which may provide enterainment at an Event (e.g. Band)
Venue and Entertainer names may not be unique. When imporinting, we may need to
consider a method from differentiating such a geoloc and/or data originator so
that the incoming data source does not have to comprehed our keys. Movie name
may need to fit in this field.

Characteristics:
 Additional descriptors/tags such as: Kid-Friendly, Religious, Free, Local-Exclusive etc.

Login States:
1) Member-Logged in:

2) Guest Browsing: 
   - Browse Events
   - View/Edit temporary ToDo cart

Add Venue:
   - Select Location
     - Browse Map for location.
     - Click map for location.
     - Allow dragging pin for location refinement.
     - Require minimum zoom to insure accuracy.
   - Select security
     - I own/manage this venue
       - I want to control who can add events (i.e. Member or Performer. Performer would allow
         control to all members with access to the Performer)
     - This is a public venue I do not own (remains public until a venue owner claims control)

Take Ownership of venue
   - Not sure how to control this, but it seems reasonable to think that a user may create a venue
     before the venue owner is on-board.

Add Event Wizard:
- Select Venue
   - Add to Exisiting Venue
     - Allow user to browse map for an existing menu. Pin click selects the venue.
       If the user does not find the venue, he may return to the "Select Venue" options.
   - Create New (Permanent) venue
   - Add event to a temporary venue (one-time location)
- Select Event Category, Characteristics
- Select Performer, if applicable
- Define Persistent Event, One-time, or recurrance

Add Performer:

Search:
 - User may be searching for one thing at a time, or mulitple. He may select these
   things based on proximity.
 - Only find events given the Map current center/zoom (on the map)
 - Return a fixed number of events (maybe add control to show more/less?)
 - Take a proportional sample of each category
   - If user selected dinner/music/movie, then consider the best approach. Take an
     even number from each, OR consider the proportion of the total events and
     include the relative number. No use in running out of events of a certain type
     when paging to the next group. Also, maybe if there are only a few hits from
     a category, we display them on every "page turn".
   - Consider search priority. Weight by rating (an event's Venue/Entertainer rating)
     and by paid promotion.

Default Landing:
 - If Member has "remained logging in", then search based on his preferences.
 - Include Paid promotions
 - Seasonal: Haunted Houses at Halloween, Easter Egg hunts

Auto Imports:
- Need to manage auto import from remote sites.

Emails:
- User may elect a weekly event email (weekend review)
- User may elect notification of an Entertainer showing up locally
- User may elect an interary reminder
- Admin stuff:
  - Notify a venue/performer before purging (due to inactivity)

SPAM:
 - System is read-only for Guests.
 - Membership validation uses email link validation.
 - Challenge-Response for all DB writes (add event, venue, etc)
 - Allow users to report violations
 - Members may have a rating based on a heuristic. The accuracy of their Ratings/violation 
   reporting/volume, etc could develop their trust-score. If they mark something as a violation
   or Rate something high/low, and it matches other Members with a high trust score, they
   gain ratings. If they differ significantly from opinions of highly trusted members, then
   their trust-score goes down.
 - Ratings and violations would consider the Member opinions based on their Trust score.
 - Membership cancelled for EULA violations.
 - Track IPA to detect SPAM?

EULA:
 - Service is provided without any gurantee of accuracy. It is highly recommended that you contact a
   Venue to confirm events/etc. to insure accuracy. 

PROMOTION:
- Create Commercial
- Share commercial on FaceBook
- Advertise commerical on youtube, locally
- Consider partnering with CSL?
  - Pitch end of life SCL? This would kick-start our Brevard presence..
  - Would have to import Member permissions (venue owners, passwords, etc)
  - If not, we need to figure out how an import would work relating their venue_id to
    our venue_id.
    - Name matches within Geo-bounds?



Update EVENTS Query
UPDATE `events` SET `date`="2016-01-23" WHERE CAT_ID LIKE "1.1%"
